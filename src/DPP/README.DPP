p4 can now be used to generate and display deceptive paths. 
deceptor.py should be located in src folder.
Any deceptive path-planners (e.g. agent_ds1.py, agent_ds2.py, etc) should be located in agents folder.
deceptor.py contains helper routines
Pass extra possible goals in config file or as array of coordinate tuples in POSS_GOALS command line parameter.
Call agent in from command line or menu and run in the usual way.

NOTES:
* For automated testing, generate problems sets exactly as for goal recognition (see GR folder). Locate dpp.py in src folder as calling script: inputs problems from nominated GR file, runs strategies (i.e. deceptive path-planning agents), and outputs results to csv. Currently, you need to hard-code the agent names in the dpp script.
